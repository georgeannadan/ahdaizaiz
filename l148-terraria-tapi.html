I'm in the middle of working on a tAPI update to Terraria 1.2.4.1 (we're still at 1.2.2, it's a shame), but sometimes I can't handle any more coding or thinking about code. Several days ago I thought I could work on a talents mod for Terraria. I'm a World of Warcraft and League of Legends player, and a gamer in general, so such systems are pretty standard for me.

Recently I began looking into mods for Terraria to see if there were any, and if they were up-to-date. I've found a few mods that add things like creative mode and inventory tweaks, but those aren't really what I'm looking for.

The PDB file allows tAPI to display line numbers on which errors happen. The Thorium and Terraria+ mods look really cool but the tApi isn't working anymore. Is modding still possible.
