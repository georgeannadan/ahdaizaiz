Hi, I'm experiencing graphics issues on my desktop and in most apps, however not present in some games, but in their menus, pixels and blending the colours of some objects into the others, as well as missing letters in words (that flash on and off). Additionally it was not present the first few weeks after building the pc, but has gradually become worse and more noticable, it also doesnt occur straight away after the PC has been off for a while, and restarting it sometimes fixes it for a coupl. Miracast not supported by graphics driver Problems android screencast windows 10 , android won't cast to windows 10 , cast android phone to pc , cast to windows 10 from android , projecting android to windows 10 , screen mirroring android to laptop. Title pretty much summarizes it.

They determined one of the fans had a bearing that went out and needed to be replaced.

I figured this is a good place to ask this question: amp#x200B; I bought a laptop with really good specs, however it runs painfully slows and it troubles me, since I believe this should not be happening. What I mean by that is that, if I want to open Chrome, this thing can take up to two minutes and sometimes more loading and appears as if it freezes.

Game will not launch past the "Loading History Files" step. It crashes on the loading screen. I am not using any mods. What I have done so far: \- Allowed "Loading History Files" to go for 10 minutes (it has never even one time taken more than 60 seconds in the past, and there has been no patch or update since I played yesterday night). \- Verified game cache. \- Restarted my computer. \- Shut my computer down, waited a 30-count, and started it back up. \- Moved the game's install folder. Hi, amp#x200B; So my laptop is about 3 and a half years old. Bought it custom built with relatively decent hardware for the time. Perhaps my biggest mistake was taking an SSHD instead of an SSD. The issue is its performance. Startup is far slower than it used to be, programs take quite a bit longer to open up. Most importantly, when playing games (currently and specifically Divinity: Original Sin 2), loading times are not as fast as should be and it often freezes up for a few seconds especia. So, it seems like I've run into the ILS problem. Usually it persists when entering or exiting an area from outside. It started about 8 hours into the game, and now it persists constantly. I have tried reinstalling which did not seem to help. amp#x200B; Here is my system information (I believe I did this right.) amp#x200B; Machine name: PC Machine Id: {42694A06-26C0-4738-987E-9BA7B6B35082} Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 17134) (17134.rs4\_release.180410-1804).

I need it at least on 60 fps to enjoy the game smoothly. amp#x200B; I have heard conflicting stories about whether or not I need to upgrade my video card or just start from scratch and upgrade the whole thing. amp#x200B; I am copying my dxdiag here so anyone who cares to take a look for me. I would really appreciate the advice! amp#x200B; Thanks in advance! amp#x200B; \------------------. 
My partner and I have the same exact machine specs and playing Blops4 has come with a lot of FATAL ERROR crashes. However, unlike my PC, his started experiencing the FATAL ERROR crash on startup. From there, it simply would not successfully launch past the logo intro. I tried your run of the mill basic troubleshooting steps, but one successfully worked. All I did was perform a 'deep scrub' of any traces of my Nvidia installation (Drivers, Registry edits, everything) using a handy tool (free). I just downloaded Wow and I attempted to play it, but it said it was unable to start up 3D acceleration. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling my graphics drivers, and disabling full screen optimization. Nothing worked.

Hello guys, I've been having crash issues since a couple days now. Game would suddenly crash and say Rendering device has been lost. I've been reading through reddits and google for solutions but honestly either they don't apply or they are too old. So I figured I'd just go on blizzard's website to ask for support, every single time I try to submit my request, regardless on which navigator \(Chrome,Edge,Firefox\) or PC \(tried 2.\) I get this nice error message saying "Something went wrong. Every time I try to update my drivers the card doesn't work. Radeon Settings never open and in device manager, windows keeps stopping the driver due to error code 43. I'm currently running on version 16.6 \(I know its really old\) and I haven't updated it since I factory reset it last time I updated it to 17.7.2. Debating whether or not to update it because I'm getting some errors like game crashing and BSODs. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- System Information \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\. Alas i am leaving the familial nest and amidst all the box and unassembled furnitures i found my old computer. It was built for me by my older brother circa 2008 if my memory is right. Now i know that most, if not all ,pieces will be severely outdated, but i'm wondering if it would be possible to upgrade it in some way, and if not should I just buy a new one outright. I game somewhat but these are mostly undemanding games like World of warcraft, stellaris, Europa Universalis 4 and such.

So recently I bought the \-\- Optiplex 745 \(Desktop\) \-\- and it was probably my biggest mistake. I didn't do enough research and I asked friends, yet they said it should be fine :\ It's my first time having a PC and I don't really have much experience. I bought the PC for gaming \(ex. Overwatch, Sims 4, Fortnite, amp other games from steam probably on recommended requirements\) and do to schoolwork on. Is it possible for me to upgrade and if so what parts? I have a Roku Premiere+ and would like to be able to stream my PC to my Roku. I am running on Windows 10, and my GPU is a EVGA NVdia Geforce 980ti. I am able to find my Roku box under Devices and it is listed as a Multimedia device (which I think is one issue). Under DXDiag, it says : Miracast: Not Supported by Graphics driver - for the GTX 980ti but under the System information part it says : Miracast: Available, with HDCP When I attempt to find the Roku under displays 
I'm new to this subreddit so please don't throw me under the bus if I unknowingly made an error with how I posted this. So I'm looking to upgrade my computer since any game I play is getting atrocious framerates (15-35 fps feelsbadman). I believe I have narrowed it down to two things: my CPU and my Video card. I am not looking to upgrade both currently, so my question is: which of these is bottlenecking my framerate?
