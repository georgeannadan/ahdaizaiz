You're all a bunch of degenerate addicts. and I love you all. I started making this when the price was at 16k. Damnit, guys. Help a brother out? Just slow down a bit. Everthing in moon math is fucked up, because the price hasn't ever moved this much while I've been making the charts. The 12 old hour values for the price are ancient. So, we're getting some mixed reporting today. 2 Moon Math tables. 1 for today's price action. kinda. Another normal chart.

If futures markets were supposed to introduce stability to Bitcoin, they're failing terribly. All measures of stability have decayed to their lowest observed levels in some time. Volume in those markets are low, and it doesn't appear to be gaining traction. If Wall Street wants to play in these waters it will need to do more than gamble on the price.

For all the doom and gloom, we still seem to be in a good position on the moon math charts. However, the price action we've seen isn't shown in the charts, yet. The closing price there is ,454.72, and we may yet work our way back up that direction today. As always, the rainbow chart.

Go to for the full update and rainbow charts I'm seeing people say things like "Bitcoin will end banks" or "my crypto of choice will end all others." People are arguing this in high profile settings, and it's unbearable to read, watch, or hear. The problem with these positions isn't that they're wrong or right, it's that they sound incredibly naive. We'll call this argument "Bitcoin Beats Banks" (BBB). On the surface, BBB is a non-starter if you're going to have a conversa. There's a new 7-day performance column today. That's going to fluctuate wildly. The results of that column are being included in the /u/nannal calculations. The new column should make higher /u/nannal percentages even harder to achieve. Today vs yesterday is a good example of that. Yesterday the rates of the 7-day performance column were basically identical to the results of the 30-day column. Today, it's showing basically sideways movement. Why is that? The closing prices we're using today. Today's update includes the LocalBitcoins USD Volume table. Volume there has been outperforming Moon Math pretty consistently, too. It makes sense to eventually start tracking the volume of all the various exchanges using this reflective measure of performance. You can apply the aproach to many different data sources. Total Exchange volume is an obvious usecase that I haven't followed through on. LocalBitcoins illustrates a different market, though.

For those who didn't catch it in the daily yesterday, the moon math site is published. Official Moon Math site : Still needs a lot of work, but I'll post Moon Math updates that link to the site from now on. The table is there and there's one rainbow chart. It wasn't that long ago that I started doing the rainbow charts. More will make their way in as time allows. A lot of people have suggestions for the site. Those are all very welcome and I need to start tracking.
